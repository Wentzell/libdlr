# Library for the Discrete Lehmann Representation **libdlr**

Authors: Jason Kaye and Hugo UR Strand (2021)

This library provides Fortran subroutines to build and work with the
discrete Lehmann representation for single particle imaginary time
Green's functions. It also includes a Python module implementing the
same functionality.

For background, installation information, and usage instructions, please
