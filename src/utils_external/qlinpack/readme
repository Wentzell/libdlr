The file qlinpack.f contains modified versions of several subroutines from the Fortran
library LINPACK. LINPACK was developed by Jack Dongarra, Jim Bunch,
Cleve Moler, and Pete Stewart. LINPACK can
be downloaded from

www.netlib.org/linpack

Specifically, we have included versions of the subroutines dgefa and
dgesl, which have been upgraded to quadruple precision and renamed qgefa
and qgesl, respectively.
