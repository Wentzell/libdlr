        subroutine iddp_qrpiv(eps,m,n,a,krank,ind,ss)
c
c       computes the pivoted QR decomposition
c       of the matrix input into a, using Householder transformations,
c       _i.e._, transforms the matrix a from its input value in
c       to the matrix out with entry
c

c
c       where in = the a from before the routine runs,
c       out = the a from after the routine runs,
c       out(j,k) = 0 when j > k (so that out is triangular),
c       q(1:m,1), ..., q(1:m,krank) are orthonormal,
c       indprod is the product of the permutations given by ind,
c       (as computable via the routine permmult,
c       with the permutation swapping 1 and ind(1) taken leftmost
c       in the product, that swapping 2 and ind(2) taken next leftmost,
c       ..., that swapping krank and ind(krank) taken rightmost),

c
c       for some matrix epsilon such that
c       the root-sum-square of the entries of epsilon
c       <= the root-sum-square of the entries of in * eps.
c       Well, technically, this routine outputs the Householder vectors
c       (or, rather, their second through last entries)
c       in the part of a that is supposed to get zeroed, that is,

c            that would otherwise consist entirely of zeroes, that is,
c            in a(j,k) with m >= j > k >= 1
c       krank -- numerical rank
c       ind(k) -- index of the k^th pivot vector;
c                 the following code segment will correctly rearrange
c                 the product b of q and the upper triangle of out
c                 so that b matches the input matrix in
