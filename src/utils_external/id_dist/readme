The file id_dist_qr.f contains several subroutines from the Fortran
library ID, Version 0.4. The library was developed by Per-Gunnar
Martinsson, Vladimir Rokhlin, Yoel Shkolnisky, and Mark Tygert. The
documentation for the full library, including copyright notice, is
contained in doc.pdf, also included in this folder. The full library can
be downloaded from

www.tygert.com/software.html

We have only included the subroutines involved in implementing the
pivoted QR algorithm, for double precision real and complex
numbers, both by precision and by rank. The subroutines have not been
modified, and can be found in the files idd_qrpiv.f, idd_house.f,
idz_qrpiv.f, and idz_house.f in the original ID library.
